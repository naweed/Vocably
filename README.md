## A fun way to improve your vocabulary
Enrich your vocabulary by playing this fun game. Vocably allows you to play multiple words in a day. Learn the meanings of new words, show off your progress to your friends, and compete against others in the world anonymously.

Vocably features 2,700 words to play for and learn. It is absolutely free; no fees, no advertisements, and no data collection from you or your device.


## NOTES:
1. Xamarin Forms version is currently published in Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xgeno.wordly) and Apple App Store (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocably/id1605208532) and is fully complete and stable.
2. Maui version is 100% complete. However, it lacks stability and polishing, due to issues with Maui framework (at the time of development).
3. I have removed the server URL and API keys from the source code (for security/privacy reasons as the APIs are hosted on my own server). Instead, I have provided the full JSON output of the API calls in the JSON_Files folder for your reference.
